            We believe that potential is evenly distributed across Indian
            society, but opportunity is not. TEN is democratizing education
            with a unique Pay After Placement (PAP) Model. PAP allows you to
            study the course of your choice at ₹0 upfront fee.

            PAP Agreement is a legal contract that makes education at TEN. It is not an education loan, as you do not have to
            pay any interest & you do not require any collaterals.
